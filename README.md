# R-to-FVS
This code takes any tree list from R and creates the FVS-ready input database. It produces an Excel file with FVS_StandInit, FVS_PlotInit, and FVS_TreeInit tabs in the same format as the [Blank FVS Database found here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/fvs/software/data.shtml), which can be read into FVS.
